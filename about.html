                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Sri Krishna College of Technology. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and I thrive on challenges that push my limits and expand my horizons.</p>
                <p>During my time at SKCT, I have engaged in numerous projects and research activities, each contributing to my growth as a student and aspiring engineer. I am particularly interested in embedded systems, communication technologies, and signal processing.</p>
                <p>During my studies, I've been delving into a wide range of subjects, from digital communication to microelectronics, and honing both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. </p>
                <!-- <p>I believe in continuous learning and am always seeking opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge. My professors, classmates, and mentors have been instrumental in my journey, and I am grateful for their support and guidance.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in hackathons, tech meetups, and volunteering for community service. These experiences have enriched my life and helped me develop a well-rounded perspective.</p> -->
